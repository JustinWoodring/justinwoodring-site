## Summary 
Privacify is an application designed to digest complex privacy policies and provide analyses in
a human readable form. Technically speaking, it leverages a combination of text segmentation, 
summarization using Large Language Models (LLMs), and map-reduce technologies to facilitate 
analyses for single-document insights and for comprehensive cross-document analysis. 
Designed with a user-centric approach, Privacify features an intuitive interface that presents all 
relevant user privacy information in easy-to-understand language, complete with a detailed explainability component. 
Our team consisted of our primary investigator, Aisha Ali-Gombi; Katherine Perez, and myself, Justin Woodring.
We evaluated our work with a ground truth analysis, including reliability and accuracy assessments, 
alongside rigorous functionality verification through ROUGE metrics, validating the systemâ€™s efficacy
and performance.
