Summary

The integration of quantum computing into governmental and
business processes has raised concerns about potential threats to
these systems. To address this, we introduce a novel extension
of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, QATT&CK, which provides a
extended taxonomy for classifying adversarial behavior in quantum
cybersecurity. Our adapted framework bridges the definitions of
traditional cybersecurity with an focus on quantum computing
infrastructure, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of
adversarial behavior in this domain.
