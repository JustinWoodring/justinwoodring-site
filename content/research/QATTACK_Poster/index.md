+++ title = "QATT&CK: Threat-Intelligence For Understanding the Hybridization of Utility-Scale Quantum Computers Based on ATT&CK" date = 2025-02-01 +++

Summary

The integration of quantum computing into governmental and business processes has raised concerns about potential threats to these systems. To address this, we introduce a novel extension of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, QATT&CK, which provides an extended taxonomy for classifying adversarial behavior in quantum cybersecurity. Our adapted framework bridges the definitions of traditional cybersecurity with a focus on quantum computing infrastructure, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of adversarial behavior in this domain.

Poster presented at Q-NET SYMPOSIUM 2025.
