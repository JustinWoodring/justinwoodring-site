  <h1 class="title">Getting Started in Quantum Computing</h1>
  <h4 class="date">2023-12-15</h4>
  <p>So you've decided to learn about quantum computing. This is the first step of a major journey
on which you have just embarked that will potentially determine the course of your professional
and academic future. But what next? What does someone who wants to learn about quantum computing do
to learn about quantum computing?</p>
<p>Well it's a good thing you're here because this post contains the answers to your questions. Before
we begin let's discuss prerequisites. Anybody can learn quantum computing, yes even your 80-year old
grandmother, but that doesn't mean it's easy. Like any discipline, understanding the intracacies of quantum
computing can take an entire lifetime because there's always more to know and the field is still
rapidly expanding, but you don't necessarily need to worry about being the next Dr. Feynman, a
simple practical understanding will do and can be achieved within a few months.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>There are a lot of conflicting opinions on the prerequisite knowledge necessary to get started. Hopefully,
in the future the people that say you don't need decent math skills will be right, but for now they're wrong.
The truth you and your 80-year old grandma probably don't want to hear, is that you'll probably need to brush up
on your math skills. At the bare minimum to get started, <strong>you will need a high school level comprehension of linear
algebra and statistics</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-news">The Good News</h2>
<p>Now I know you're probably disgruntled at the unfortunate news, but it's not all bad. In reality,
the necessary math may have rattled it's way out of your brain but it's not complex and certainly
it's knowledge that can be refreshed within a quarter of the year or less. It doesn't get much more
difficult than this.</p>
<h2 id="getting-into-quantum">Getting Into Quantum</h2>
<p>Now that you've refreshed your math skills you're ready to start your quantum journey. This is the fun part.
With the most of the world calling for a quantum-ready workforce almost evey major tech company is either
creating resources for or keeping an eye out for people like you who are going to lead tech into the post-quantum
era.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>Tutorials and hand-on exercises are fun but the bread and butter of any discipline is textbooks. And I've personally
identified three textbooks aimed at various levels of quantum proficiency to get you started and let you progress steadily
in you quantum studies.</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing (By Dr. Thomas G Wong) -- Highschool to Early College Level</li>
<li>Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (By Isaac Chuang and Michael Nielsen) -- College to Early Graduate Level</li>
<li>Classical and Quantum Computation (By Kitaev et al.) -- Graduate and Heavy Mathematics Level</li>
</ol>
<p>These three books are ideal for any collection and will serve well to introduce and reinforce well-known quantum
computing concepts. The 1st book is very approachable for beginners and the 2nd book serves as the de facto standard
for college level quantum computation textbooks.</p>
<h3 id="online-resources">Online Resources</h3>
<p>There are four really good courses online that offer hands-on exercises labs and opportunities to experiment with real
quantum hardware!</p>
<ol>
<li>IBM Quantum / Qiskit (Big Blue is leading the pack by far in creating educational content and making quantum 
publicly accessible)</li>
<li>Xanadu's Pennylane (Xanadu's Pennylane Cookbook is a book of hands-on exercises that walk you through a
programmatic understanding of quantum concepts)</li>
<li>Amazon's free Introduction to Braket Course <strong>and Badge!</strong> (Shorter course but it walks through using Amazon's Tech)</li>
<li>Microsoft's QDK, Q#, and Introduction to Azure Quantum (Microsoft despite not bragging too much about quantum has silently been building and
accruing a collection of useful resources and documentation for any quantum beginner. They even have their own language!)</li>
</ol>
<p>I personally recommend spending time on all of these not only does it look good to be well-rounded but learning different toolsets
will help you to distinguish more abstract quantum concepts from implementation specific features.</p>
<h3 id="events-and-other">Events and Other</h3>
<p>There are several events that occur throughout the year that you can either participate in at low cost
or simply for free. It's worth keeping an eye on these. One such event that comes to mind is QHack, a
worldwide quantum hackathon / distinguished speakers event put on by XanaduAI.</p>
<p>Aside from events, depending on your interests it may be worth keeping up with research papers to get a better
understanding of the current state of quantum tech. An IBM interns and quantum advocates put together a really
valuable collection of quantum research papers, https://github.com/mgg39/Quantum-tech-papers.</p>
<h3 id="in-summary">In Summary</h3>
<p>There's no super easy way to get started in quantum but it's certainly doable. In my opinion, you should read the
textbooks, complete the courses, get hands-on experience, and keep with the latest research as much as is feasibly
possible. If videos are more your speed, there are several provided in the various courses and as extra educational
resources by various outlets. All this being said, it's an amazing time to get started and you shouldn't let your
doubts or fears or even imposter syndrome hold you back. I wish you the best of luck on your journey and hopefully
this and more content I'll produce later will be an invaluable asset to you!</p>
