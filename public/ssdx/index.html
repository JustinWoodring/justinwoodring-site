    <h2>Meet the Creator üëã</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Justin Woodring.</p>
    <p>I created Snowman Sniper years ago as a labor of love. Now I'm bringing a revised version, Snowman Sniper DX, to
      world.</p>

      <p>
      Snowman Sniper DX is a fun casual game with a competitive arcade style edge. It's fun for friends or family and
      great for kids too! As a computer
      scientist by trade and profession, I respect your desire for fun, gimmick free, privacy respecting, and safe
      software. And I have great news for you,
      I'm not a money-hungry triple-A game studio and I don't want your data.</p>
      
      <p>If you love Snowman Sniper DX as much as I
      do, share it with your friends. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
