    <h2>Meet the creator</h2>
      <p>Hello, I'm Justin Woodring, I created Snowman Sniper as a labor of love. Now I'm bringing a revised version to world, Snowman Sniper DX. 
        Snowman Sniper DX, is a fun casual game with a competitive arcade style edge. It's fun for friends or family and great for kids too! As a computer
        scientist by trade and profession, I also respect your desire for fun, gimmick free, privacy respecting, safe software. And I have great news for you,
        I'm not a money-hungry triple-A game studio and I don't want your data. If you love Snowman Sniper DX as much as I do share it with your friends.</p>
